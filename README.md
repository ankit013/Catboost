# Catboost
Implementing Catboost

CatBoost is a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision trees. It is available as an open source library.It is a powerfull library build by Yandex community.
This note book deals with indepth understandin of how to implement the catboost algorithm on the data and improving the accuracy of the model.

A breif discussion on the installation in python and understanding the features are covered under this notebook.
